# You can deploy your Image as either a single Container or as a Container 
# Group.  A Container Group deploys a number of containers to enhance
# scalability or reliability.  By default we will deploy as a single 
# container.  To switch to a group deploy, comment out the line below
# containing deploycontainer.sh and uncomment the line for deploygroup.sh
